# Zig Machine Learning Framework

This project implements a conceptual machine learning framework in Zig, demonstrating how to structure a cross-functional model that interfaces with various machine learning libraries.

## Overview

The Zig Machine Learning Framework provides a flexible structure for working with machine learning models in Zig. It includes components for data handling, model creation and training, cross-validation, and feature selection.

Key components:
- Dataset handling
- Model configuration and training
- Cross-validation
- Feature selection

Please note that this framework is conceptual and relies on hypothetical external C libraries for core machine learning functionality.

## Requirements

- Zig compiler (developed with version X.X.X)
- Hypothetical C libraries:
  - `some_ml_lib.h`
  - `another_ml_lib.h`

## Project Structure

- `main.zig`: Contains the entire framework implementation
  - `Dataset`: Struct for handling feature data and labels
  - `Model`: Struct for creating and using ML models
  - `CrossValidator`: Implements k-fold cross-validation
  - `FeatureSelector`: Implements feature importance and selection

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the Zig compiler installed.
2. Set up the required C libraries (in a real-world scenario, you would need to properly link these).
3. Compile the project:
   ```
   zig build-exe main.zig
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./main
   ```

## Example

The `main` function in `main.zig` provides an example of how to use the framework:

1. Create a dataset
2. Configure and initialize a model
3. Perform cross-validation
4. Use feature selection

## Extending the Framework

To use this framework with real machine learning libraries:

1. Replace the hypothetical C function calls with actual calls to your chosen ML library.
2. Implement proper memory management and error handling for the external library calls.
3. Extend the `ModelType` enum and `Model` struct to support additional model types as needed.
